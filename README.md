 PHP has many built-in functions. Unfortunately, those functions do not offer the necessary functionality in some situations.
 E.g. it's not possible for in_array() to check if a substring exists in the given array. 
 The function array_search() searches by string comparison, it doesn't search by pattern matching. 
 
 The library jPHP offers a collection of functions that are based on existing php functions but with extended functionality.
